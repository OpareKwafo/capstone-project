# Capstone-Project

This project involves predicting the outcome of Spanish Premier League matches using Machine Learning.
I explored 10 different models to make predictions on the outcome of a game.

## About the Project

Project uses 6 seasons of matches from 2018 to the current 2023 season.

Data is obtained from fbref.com which has statistics on most of the major soccer leagues and competitions in the world. Data is obtained using web scraping techniques. The original dataset has 4322 matches with 27 columns. Features ranges from numeric statistics like goals, shots on targets, penalties, average distance to shots to descriptive statistics like opponent, venue, day of game and time of play.

Detailed feature description can be found in the scrapping_six.ipynb file.
